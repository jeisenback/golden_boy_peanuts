## Next Sprint Preview

**Sprint 1 — Phase 0: Project Setup**

Candidate issues (Phase 0 milestone):
- #1 Initialize GitHub repository: labels, milestones, branch protection
- #2 Local development environment: Docker Compose for Postgres
- #3 Refactor: extract shared get_engine() to src/core/db.py (DRY)
- #4 Refactor: extract shared tenacity retry config to src/core/retry.py (DRY)
- #5 CI pipeline verification: confirm all 4 workflows run green

Run `gh issue list --milestone "Phase 0: Project Setup"` to see full list.

## HEARTBEAT Update Protocol

**Human updates HEARTBEAT at:**
- Sprint start: run `bash scripts/sprint_start.sh` (script writes sprint header block)
- Sprint close: run `bash scripts/sprint_close.sh` (script appends retro + summary)
- Any scope change, new blocker, or milestone shift mid-sprint

**Claude updates HEARTBEAT at:**
- Session end: promote Key Decisions from SESSION.md into sprint notes
- When an issue changes status (e.g., Not Started → In Progress → In Review)
- When a blocker is discovered or resolved
- Commit format: `chore: update HEARTBEAT after session YYYY-MM-DD (#issue)`

**HEARTBEAT is stale if:**
- The "Current Active Branch" does not match what `git branch --show-current` shows
- Sprint issues have changed status but the table has not been updated
- The last session was >24 hours ago and sprint notes have no new entries
- Status still says "PLANNING" after sprint_start.sh was run
